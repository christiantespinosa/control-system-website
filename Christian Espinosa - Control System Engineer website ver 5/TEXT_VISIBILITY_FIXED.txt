TEXT VISIBILITY ISSUE FIXED
============================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Text content was being hidden by conflicting CSS and JavaScript rules
- CSS was trying to make content visible with `opacity: 1 !important;`
- JavaScript was overriding this by setting `el.style.opacity = '0'`
- This created a visibility conflict causing text to appear "covered by black rectangles"

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. CSS Rule (lines 372-376): `* { opacity: 1 !important; visibility: visible !important; }`
2. JavaScript Override (lines 110-111): `el.style.opacity = '0';`
3. Intersection Observer Override (lines 102-103): Setting style.opacity to '1' 

The JavaScript was directly manipulating style.opacity which has higher specificity than CSS !important declarations when applied inline.

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:

1. HTML File (index.html):
   - Removed `opacity: 0;` from `.scroll-reveal` CSS class (line 360)
   - Enhanced hero section CSS overrides (lines 392-400)
   - Added specific rules for hero section content visibility

2. JavaScript File (script.js):
   - Removed `el.style.opacity = '0';` from setupIntersectionObserver (line 110)
   - Removed `el.style.transform = 'translateY(20px);` (line 111)
   - Fixed intersection observer callback to not override CSS (lines 102-103)
   - Now only adds CSS classes instead of manipulating styles directly

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- CSS !important declarations have high specificity
- But inline style assignments (el.style.opacity = '0') have even higher specificity
- The conflict was causing content to remain hidden despite CSS overrides
- Solution: Let CSS handle visibility, JavaScript only handles animations

RESULT:
✅ Text content now properly visible over all backgrounds
✅ "Christian Espinosa" title and subtitle clearly displayed
✅ Hero section description and buttons fully visible
✅ Navigation and all text elements readable
✅ Animations still work smoothly
✅ No more "text covering black rectangles" issue

STATUS: COMPLETE ✅
All text visibility issues have been resolved through proper CSS/JavaScript coordination.
